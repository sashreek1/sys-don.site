  content : "We are a group of high school students who believe in the wonders of computing.
   While we are fortunate enough to have our own computers, there are many who aren't.  With the sudden transition to online learning, due to the pandemic, many unfortunate students are being left behind.
   Through this initiative, we wish to share the opportunity to cherish the joy of computing and learning with those who arenâ€™t fortunate enough."

  Through this initiative we contact individuals, institutions and large companies to collect donations in the form of old or used computers.
   We then install appropriate software and configure the systems to make it usable for students.
    The renewed computers are then distributed to individuals who are unable to afford their own systems."
