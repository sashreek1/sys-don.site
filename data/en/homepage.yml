  title : "Who Are We ?"
  description : ""
  content : "We are a group of high school students who have enjoyed the experience of using a computer for 
  a considerable amount of time. Some of us have even built our own computers from scratch. 
  Yet, there are many students who havenâ€™t even had the chance to call a computer their own. 
  As teaching has gone completely online due to the pandemic, it has become a necessity for students to have their own systems. 
  Through our initiative, We help the students who are unable to afford their own systems by providing it to them from various 
  institutions, companies and individuals. All the necessary modifications are done by ourselves. 
  We sincerely hope that you will support us in taking this initiative forward, to help us ensure that no 
  student goes without proper education."
